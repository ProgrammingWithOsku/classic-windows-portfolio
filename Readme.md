# XP Portfolio

Welcome to my Windows XP-themed portfolio! This project is a nostalgic journey back to the early 2000s, showcasing my work and skills with a touch of classic Windows design. The portfolio is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with retro styling and interactive features inspired by Windows XP.

## 📜 Overview

This portfolio recreates the look and feel of Windows XP, complete with a startup sound, XP-style buttons, a loading screen, and a modal that lets visitors choose their language upon first visit. It serves as a showcase of my projects and skills, as well as a fun way to display my personal style.

## ✨ Features

- **Windows XP-Inspired Design**: The entire UI mimics classic XP, including buttons, modals, and colors.
- **Language Selection Modal**: First-time visitors can choose their preferred language (Finnish, English, or Arabic).
- **Cookie Consent Popup**: A friendly, retro-style cookie consent popup that appears on first visit.
- **Loading Spinner**: Windows XP-style loading spinner appears when the page is loading, with a minimum 3-second display.
- **XP Startup Sound**: Plays the Windows XP startup sound on first visit (requires user interaction due to browser restrictions).
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes for accessibility and customization.
